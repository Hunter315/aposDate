# aposDate
aposDate is an online dating application that pairs users within a given location. It utilizes swipe cards, Firebase Realtime Database, AWS S3 bucket, and React Native. It is to be marketed to Utah residents that are previously members of the most popular faith and wanted to look for like-minded people to form relationships with.


## User Flow
The User is prompted to login with Facebook, and then proceeds to a main screen where they will automatically be paired with other users within their location radius, defaulted to 12km. 

### Tech Stack
React Native with Redux state management to connect post-religious users. Auth setup using Firebase with Facebook integration. Backend + DB managed using Firebase Realtime Database, location using latlon-geohash npm package.

### Project State
This is a WIP, but is still a great showcase of what I can do with React Native.
